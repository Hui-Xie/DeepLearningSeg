Program ID of SkyWatcher Network training:16140

Program command: 
 ['TrainSkyWatcherPurePrediction.py', '/home/hxie1/temp_netParameters/OvarianCancer/SkyWatcher/PurePrediction', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/Extract_ps2_2_5/Images_ROI_29_140_140', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/patientResponseDict.json']

Major program changes: 
                      merge train and test dataMgr into one.
                      when epoch %5 ==0, do not use mixup.
                      Directly use 3D data for treatment prediction without segmentation. 
                      Number of filters in encoder is 64.
                      Only epoch %5 ==0, print log
                      Use BatchNorm1d in FC layer, instead of InstanceNorm1d.
                       

Experiment setting for Image3d ROI to response:
Input CT data: 29*140*140  3D CT raw image ROI with spacing size(5*2*2)

Predictive Model: 1,  first 3-layer dense conv block with channel size 128.
                  2,  and 3 dense conv DownBB blocks,  each of which includes a stride 2 conv and 3-layers dense conv block; 
                  3,  and 3 fully connected layers  changes the tensor into size 2*1;
                  4,  final a softmax for binary classification;
                  Total network learning parameters are 8 million.
                  Network architecture is referred at https://github.com/Hui-Xie/OvarianCancer/blob/master/SkyWatcherModel.py

response Loss Function:   focus loss  with weight [3.3, 1.4] for [0,1] class separately, as [0,1] uneven distribution.

Data:   training data has 113 patients, and valdiation data has 27 patients with training/test rate 80/20.
        We randomize all data, and then assign same distrubtion of treat reponse 0,1 into to training and test data set.


Training strategy:  50% probability of data are mixed up with beta distribution with alpha =0.4, to feed into network for training. 
                    No other data augmentation, and no dropout.  

                    Learning Scheduler:  Reduce learning rate on  plateau, and learning rate patience is 30 epochs.
