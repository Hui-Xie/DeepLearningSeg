Program ID of SkyWatcher Network training:21371

Program command: 
 ['TrainSkyWatcher.py', '/home/hxie1/temp_netParameters/OvarianCancer/SkyWatcher', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/Extract_ps2_2_5/images_npy', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/Extract_ps2_2_5/labels_npy', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/patientResponseDict.json']

Major program changes: 
                      along deeper layer, increase filter number.
                      10 fold cross validation, 0 fold for test.
                      data partition with patient ID, instead of VOI.
                      in image3dResponseDataMgr, random Crop ROI in the fly.
                      erase normalization layers  in the fully connected layers.
                      Crop ROI around the mass center in each labeled slice. 
                      use bootStrapping in both trainSet and testSet
                      

Experiment setting for Image3d ROI to response:
Input CT data: 29*140*140  3D CT raw image ROI with spacing size(5*2*2)
segmentation label: 23*127*127 with spacing size(5*2*2) segmentation label with value (0,1,2) which erases lymph node label

This is a multi-task learning. 

Predictive Model: 1,  first 3-layer dense conv block with channel size 128.
                  2,  and 3 dense conv DownBB blocks,  each of which includes a stride 2 conv and 3-layers dense conv block; 
                  3,  and 3 fully connected layers  changes the tensor into size 2*1;
                  4,  final a softmax for binary classification;
                  Total network learning parameters are 8 million.
                  Network architecture is referred at https://github.com/Hui-Xie/OvarianCancer/blob/master/SkyWatcherModel.py

response Loss Function:   focus loss  with weight [3.3, 1.4] for [0,1] class separately, as [0,1] uneven distribution.
segmentation loss function: focus loss  with weight [1.0416883685076772, 39.37007874015748, 68.39945280437757] for label (0, 1, 2)

Data:   training data has 113 patients, and valdiation data has 27 patients with training/test rate 80/20.
        We randomize all data, and then assign same distrubtion of treat reponse 0,1 into to training and test data set.
        

Training strategy:  50% probability of data are mixed up with beta distribution with alpha =0.4, to feed into network for training. 
                    No other data augmentation, and no dropout.  

                    Learning Scheduler:  Reduce learning rate on  plateau, and learning rate patience is 30 epochs.

Now program get 169 input files.
Infor: In all data of 169 files, respone 0 has 51 files,
	  and response 1 has 118 files, where positive response rate = 0.6982248520710059 in full data
Infor: Validation Set has 16 files,and Training Set has 153 files
Infor: Validataion set has 11 1's, and positive response rate = 0.6875
Infor: trainning set has 107 1's, and positive response rate = 0.6993464052287581
Infor: the drop_last data in the dataMgr may lead the number of validation set and training set less than above number.
