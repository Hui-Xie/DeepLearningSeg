Major program changes: 
                      along deeper layer, increase filter number.
                      10 fold cross validation, 0 fold for test.
                      data partition with patient ID, instead of VOI.
                      in image3dResponseDataMgr, random Crop ROI in the fly.
                      erase normalization layers  in the fully connected layers.
                      Crop ROI around the mass center in each labeled slice. 
                      use reSampleForSameDistribution in training set, but keep original ditribution in the test set
                      First implement 1000 epochs in the segmentation path, and then freeze the encoder and decoder, only train the ResponseBranch.  
                      epoch < 1000, the loss is pure segmentation loss;
                      epoch >= 1000, the loss is pure response loss with reinitialized learning rate 1e-3.
                      add FC layer width = 980.
                      without dropout.
                                                    
 
Discarded changes:                      
                      training response branch per 5 epoch after epoch 100, while continuing train the segmenation branch.
                      which means that before epoch 100, the accuray data is a mess.
                      Add L2 norm regularization in Adam optimizer with weight 5e-4. 
                      Add dropout at Fully connected layer with dropout rate of 50%.     
                      

Experiment setting for Image3d ROI to response:
Input CT data: 29*140*140  3D CT raw image ROI with spacing size(5*2*2)
segmentation label: 23*127*127 with spacing size(5*2*2) segmentation label with value (0,1,2) which erases lymph node label

This is a multi-task learning. 

Predictive Model: 1,  first 3-layer dense conv block with channel size 128.
                  2,  and 3 dense conv DownBB blocks,  each of which includes a stride 2 conv and 3-layers dense conv block; 
                  3,  and 3 fully connected layers  changes the tensor into size 2*1;
                  4,  final a softmax for binary classification;
                  Total network learning parameters are 8 million.
                  Network architecture is referred at https://github.com/Hui-Xie/OvarianCancer/blob/master/SkyWatcherModel.py

response Loss Function:   focus loss  with weight [3.3, 1.4] for [0,1] class separately, as [0,1] uneven distribution.
segmentation loss function: focus loss  with weight [1.0416883685076772, 39.37007874015748, 68.39945280437757] for label (0, 1, 2)

Data:   training data has 113 patients, and valdiation data has 27 patients with training/test rate 80/20.
        We randomize all data, and then assign same distrubtion of treat reponse 0,1 into to training and test data set.
        

Training strategy:  50% probability of data are mixed up with beta distribution with alpha =0.4, to feed into network for training. 
                    No other data augmentation, and no dropout.  

                    Learning Scheduler:  Reduce learning rate on  plateau, and learning rate patience is 30 epochs.

Network has total 23,396,593 parameters.
Infor: Segmentation Cross Entropy Weight: [1.0416883685076772, 39.37007874015748, 68.39945280437757] for label (0, 1, 2)
Info: program will use 3 GPUs.
Loss Functions List: FocalCELoss with weight of 1; 	FocalCELoss with weight of 1; 
when epoch < 1000, only train segmentation, which means response accuracy are meaningless at these epoch.
when epoch >= 1000, only training response branch, which means segmentation accuracy should keep unchange.
Hints: Test Dice_0 is the dice coeff for all non-zero labels
Hints: Test Dice_1 is for primary cancer(green), 	
 test Dice_2 is for metastasis(yellow), 	
 and test Dice_3 is for invaded lymph node(brown).
Hints: Test TPR_0 is the TPR for all non-zero labels
Hints: Test TPR_1 is for primary cancer(green), 	
 TPR_2 is for metastasis(yellow), 	
 and TPR_3 is for invaded lymph node(brown).

Dice is based on all 2D segmented slices in the volume from weak annotation, not real 3D dice.
