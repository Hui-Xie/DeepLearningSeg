Major program changes: ConvResidual use BatchNorm-reLU-Conv structure; 
                       ConsDense also use BatchNorm-reLU-Conv structure.
                       Add ConvSegDecreaseChannels
                       and each block has 5 layers, 
                       Residual connect to each Conv, 
                       skip at least 2 layers.
                       output layer use conv with 3*3 fiter instead of 1*1 filter. 
                       use boundary loss with weight 0 at beginning, and pretrain CE loss. 
                       special convInput Module
                       convOutput moudel uses 1*1 conv to tranparent gradident 
                       ConvOutput use residual module.
                       Use Dense Net in the Building Block
                       add ConvBlock to wrapp the ConvResidual and ConvDense
