Info: netPath = /home/hxie1/temp_netParameters/OvarianCancer/ResNeXtVNet/20190830_132831

Info: this is the 0th fold leave for test in the 5-fold cross-validation.

Info: batchSize = 4

Net parameters is saved in  /home/hxie1/temp_netParameters/OvarianCancer/ResNeXtVNet/20190830_132831.
Program statistics label according to label[0] for each sample.
Infor: In all data of 220 files, label 0 has 50 files,
	  and label 1 has 170 files, where positive response rate = 0.7727272727272727 in full data
5-fold cross validation: the 0th fold is for test, the 1th fold is for validation, remaining folds are for training.
