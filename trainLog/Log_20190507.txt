Program command: 
 ['/home/hxie1/Projects/OvarianCancer/TrainSegV.py', '/home/hxie1/temp_netParameters/OvarianCancer/Label0_1', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/Extract_uniform/trainImages', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/Extract_uniform/trainLabels', '2D', '0,1']

Major program changes: ConvSeqential use BatchNorm-reLU-Conv structure; 
                       Add ConvSegDecreaseChannels
                       and each block has 5 layers, 
                       Residual connect to each Conv, 
                       skip at least 2 layers.
                       output layer use conv with 3*3 fiter instead of 1*1 filter. 
                       use boundary loss with weight 0 at beginning, and pretrain CE loss.
