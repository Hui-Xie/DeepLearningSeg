Major program changes: 
      1  3D V model for primary cancer ROI;
      2  Uniform ROI size: 51*171*171 in z,y,x directon;
      3  Total 36 patient data, in which training data 24 patients, validation 6 patients, and test 6 patients;
      4  all 36 patients data have 50-80% 3D label;
      5  Dice coefficient is 3D dice coefficient against corresponding 3D ground truth;
      6  training data augmentation in the fly: affine in XY plane, translation in Z direction;
      7  In the bottle neck of V model, the latent vector has size of 512*2*9*9;
      Sep 16th, 2019:
      1   add dynamic loss weight according trainin  data;
      2   refine learning rate decay.
      Sep 21st, 2019
      1   add improved Boundary Loss2, and inherit the previous learningrate of network of pure CELoss;
      Sep 23rd, 2019:
      1   improve mean of boundary loss limited on the A,B regions;
      2   use log(segProb) instead of segProb in the boudary loss;
      3   CrossEntropy weight reduces 0.01 per 5 epochs from 1 to 0.01, while boundary Loss weight increase 0.01 per 5 epochs from 0.01 to 1. 
      Sep 24th, 2019
      1   Use boundaryLoss1, which is considering the whole volume. 
      Sep 25th, 2019
      1   use boundaryLoss3, which is a stronger gradient signal to improve loss.
      2   unbalanced weight for class is applied on logP,and just use boundaryLoss3 with CELoss.
      3   use CELoss and boundaryLoss together.
      4   Use truncated DistanceCrossEntropy Loss alone;
      5   change LRScheduler into reduce into Plateau with initial LR=0.1
      Sep 26th, 2019
      1   Add one layer in the bottom of V model;
      2   Add residual connnection in each layer;
      Sep 30th, 2019
      1   With size-reduced ROI of size 51*149*149;
      2   reduce the translation of data augmentation;
      3   reduce all data into 35 patients, excluding a very blur patient.
