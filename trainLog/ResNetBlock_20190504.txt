Program command: 
 ['/home/hxie1/Projects/OvarianCancer/TrainSegV.py', '/home/hxie1/temp_netParameters/OvarianCancer/test', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/Extract_uniform/trainImages', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/Extract_uniform/trainLabels', '2D', '0,1']

Major program changes: ConvSeqential use ReLU-BN-Conv structure, 
                       and each block has 5 layers, 
                       Residual connect to each Conv
                       use boundary loss with weight 0 at beginning, and pretrain CE loss.
