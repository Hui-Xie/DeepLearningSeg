Major program changes: 
                      along deeper layer, increase filter number.
                      10 fold cross validation
                      data partition with patient ID, instead of VOI.
                      in image3dResponseDataMgr, random Crop ROI in the fly.
                      erase all normalization layers in the fully connected layers.
                      Crop ROI around the mass center in each labeled slice. 
                      use reSampleForSameDistribution in training set, but keep original ditribution in the test set
                      First implement 1000 epochs in the segmentation path, and then freeze the encoder and decoder, only train the ResponseBranch.  
                      epoch < 1000, the loss is pure segmentation loss;
                      add FC layer width = 256*49 at first FC layer, and halves along deeper FC layer.
                      add data window level adjust, slice Normalization, gausssian noise, random flip, 90/180/270 rotation. 
                      reset learning rate patience after 1000 epochs.
                      disable data augmentation in the validation data;
                      in response prediction path, learning rate decacy patience set as 200 instead of 30.
                      when disable data augmentation, choose the fixed center labeled slice from a patient.
                      epoch >= 1000,  only training FC branch, and freeze encocoder and decode. 
                      use dropout with rate 0.2 in  FC layers.
                                                    
 
Discarded changes:                      
                      training response branch per 5 epoch after epoch 100, while continuing train the segmenation branch.
                      which means that before epoch 100, the accuray data is a mess.
                      Add L2 norm regularization in Adam optimizer with weight 5e-4. 
                      Add dropout at Fully connected layer with dropout rate of 50%.  
                      focus loss  with weight [3.3, 1.4] for [0,1] class separately, as [0,1] uneven distribution.   
                       the loss is pure response loss with reinitialized learning rate 1e-3.
                      

Experiment setting for Image3d ROI to response:

segmentation label: 23*127*127 with spacing size(5*2*2) segmentation label with value (0,1,2) which erases lymph node label


Predictive Model: 1,  first 3-layer dense conv block with channel size 128.
                  2,  and 3 dense conv DownBB blocks,  each of which includes a stride 2 conv and 3-layers dense conv block; 
                  3,  and 3 fully connected layers  changes the tensor into size 2*1;
                  4,  final a softmax for binary classification;
                  Total network learning parameters are 119 million.

response Loss Function:  focus loss with weight 1:1 as training data use response balance distribution with resample with replacement. 
segmentation loss function: focus loss  with weight [1.0416883685076772, 39.37007874015748, 68.39945280437757] for label (0, 1, 2)

Data:   training data has 153 patients, and valdiation data has 16 patients, under 10 fold partition.
        We randomize all data, and then assign same distrubtion of treat reponse 0,1 into to training set;
        Validation data set keep original distribution
        

Training strategy:  50% probability of data are mixed up with beta distribution with alpha =0.4, to feed into network for training. 
                    No other data augmentation, and no dropout.  

                    Learning Scheduler for segmentation:  Reduce learning rate on  plateau, and learning rate patience is 300 epochs.

Infor: Segmentation Cross Entropy Weight: [1.0416883685076772, 39.37007874015748, 68.39945280437757] for label (0, 1, 2)
Info: program will use 3 GPUs.
Loss Functions List: FocalCELoss with weight of 1; 	FocalCELoss with weight of 1; 
when epoch < 1000, only train segmentation, which means response accuracy are meaningless at these epoch.
when epoch >= 1000, only training response branch, which means segmentation accuracy should keep unchange.
Hints: Test Dice_0 is the dice coeff for all non-zero labels
