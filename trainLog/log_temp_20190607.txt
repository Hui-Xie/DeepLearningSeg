Major program changes: 
                     delete the m_k in the DataMgr class.
                      

Experiment setting for Image3d ROI to response:
Input CT data: 147*281*281  3D CT raw image ROI
segmentation label: 127*255*255 segmentation label with value (0,1,2) which erases lymph node label

This is a multi-task learning. 

Predictive Model: 1,  first 3-layer dense conv block with channel size 6.
                  2,  and 6 dense conv DownBB blocks,  each of which includes a stride 2 conv and 3-layers dense conv block; 
                  3,  and 3 fully connected layers  changes the tensor into size 2*1;
                  4,  final a softmax for binary classification;
                  Total network learning parameters are 27 K.
                  Network architecture is referred at https://github.com/Hui-Xie/OvarianCancer/blob/master/Image3dPredictModel.py

response Loss Function:   focus loss  with weight [3.3, 1.4] for [0,1] class separately, as [0,1] uneven distribution.
segmentation loss function: focus loss  with weight [1.0416883685076772, 39.37007874015748, 68.39945280437757] for label (0, 1, 2)

Data:   training data has 130 patients, and test data has 32 patients with training/test rate 80/20.
        We used patient ID as index to order all patients data, and then used about the first 80% of patients as training data, 
        and the remaining 20% of patients as test data. 
        Sorting with patient ID is to make sure the division of training and test set is blind to the patient's detailed stage, 
        shape and size of cancer.  
        Therefore you will see that patient IDs of all test data are beginning at 8 or 9. 
        This training/test division is exactly same with segmentation network experiment before. 

Training strategy:  50% probability of data are mixed up with beta distribution with alpha =0.4, to feed into network for training. 
                    No other data augmentation, and no dropout.  

                    Learning Scheduler:  Reduce learning rate on  plateau, and learning rate patience is 30 epochs.
