Major program changes: ConvDense uses Conv-Bn-ReLU order (CBR)
                       Dense Layer = 4 
                       output layer use conv with 3*3 fiter instead of 1*1 filter. 
                       use boundary loss with weight 0 at beginning, and pretrain CE loss. 
                       special convInput Module
                       convOutput moudel uses 1*1 conv to get tranparent gradient 
                       ConvOutput use residual module.
                       first layer filter = 128
                       use Mixup and DenseNet
                       Boundary Loss supports multi-class, and weight
                       Only  0,1 two classes clasfication for primary
                       cancel dropout layers in the network.
                       using ResPath bridge V model
