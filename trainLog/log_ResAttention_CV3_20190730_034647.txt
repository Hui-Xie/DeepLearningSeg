Major program changes: 
            ResNeXt-based Attention Net: use 2D network to implement 3D convolution without losing 3D context information. 
            0   the input is a 3D full volume without any cropping; 
            1   Use slices as features channels in convolutions,  and use 1*1 convolution along slices direction to implement z direction convolution followed by 3*3 convolutino inside slice planes;
                It just uses three cascading 2D convolutions (first z, then xy, and z direction again) to implement 3D convolution, like in the paper of ResNeXt below.
                The benefits of this design:
                A   reduce network parameters, hoping to reducing overfitting;
                B   speed up training;
                C   this implemented 3D convolutions are all in full slices space;
            2   use group convolution to implement thick slice convolution to increase the network representation capability;
            3   Use ResNeXt-based module like Paper "Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks " 
                (Link: http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Xie_Aggregated_Residual_Transformations_CVPR_2017_paper.html);
            4   use rich 2D affine transforms slice by slice and concatenate them to implement 3D data augmentation;
            5   20% data for independent test, remaining 80% data for 4-fold cross validation;
            6   add lossweight to adjust positive samples to 3/7 posweight in BCEWithLogitsLoss;
            
            Update:
            1    reduced network parameters to 3.14 million in July 27th, 2019, 0840am
            2    at 15:00 of July 27th, 2019, reduce network parameter again. Now each stage has 160 filters, with 1.235 million parameters
            3    keep 2) parameter, change all maxpooling into average pooling.
            4    At July 29th 09:37am, 2019, reduce filters to 96 to further reduce parameters, keep avgPool.
            5    at July 29th 11:25am, 2019,  reduce filter number to 48, and redue one stage
            6    at July 29th 12:41, 2019:
                    add GPUID in command line;
                    use SGD optimizer, instead of Adam
                    add numbers of filters along deeper layer with step 12.
                    add saveDir's tims stamp;
            7    at July 29th 15:18, 2019,
                    change learning rate step_size = 5 from 10;
                    before FC, we use conv2d
                    learning rate start at 0.5.
            8    at July 30th 03:00, 2019:
                    add learning rate print;
                    use stride =2;
                    add filter number by 2 times along deeper layers.
