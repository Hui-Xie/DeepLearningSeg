Program ID: 11988

Program command: 
 ['TrainResNeXtVNet.py', '/home/hxie1/temp_netParameters/OvarianCancer/ResNeXtVNet', '1', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/pixelSize223withLabel/numpy', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/pixelSize223withLabel/numpyLabel', '0', '3,2,1']

Major program changes: 
     1  a V model with ResNeXt block: use z convolution, and then xy convolution, to implement 3D convolution.
     2  at ground truth, only check the segmented slices, about 3 slices per patient;
     3  the input is whole 3D volume, instead of ROI around a segmented slice;
     4  support input data augmentation: affine in xy plane, and translation in z direction;
     5  input Size: 231*251*251 with label, instead of previous SkyWatch Model of 29*140*140;
     6  treat all 1,2,3 labels as 1, in other words, do not differentiate primary, metastase, and nymph node;  
    

Discarded changes:
