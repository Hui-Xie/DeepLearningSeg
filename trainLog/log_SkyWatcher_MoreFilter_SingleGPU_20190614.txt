Program ID of SkyWatcher Network training:17044

Program command: 
 ['TrainSkyWatcher.py', '/home/hxie1/temp_netParameters/OvarianCancer/SkyWatcher', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/Extract_ps2_2_5/Images_ROI_29_140_140', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/Extract_ps2_2_5/Labels_ROI_23_127_127', '/home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/patientResponseDict.json']

Major program changes: 
                      merge train and test dataMgr into one.
                      when epoch %5 ==0, do not use mixup.
                      And Only when epoch %5 ==0, print log and save.
                      Along the encoder, use more filters. And the first layer has 64 filters.
                      

Experiment setting for Image3d ROI to response:
Input CT data: 29*140*140  3D CT raw image ROI with spacing size(5*2*2)
segmentation label: 23*127*127 with spacing size(5*2*2) segmentation label with value (0,1,2) which erases lymph node label

This is a multi-task learning. 

Predictive Model: 1,  first 3-layer dense conv block with channel size 128.
                  2,  and 3 dense conv DownBB blocks,  each of which includes a stride 2 conv and 3-layers dense conv block; 
                  3,  and 3 fully connected layers  changes the tensor into size 2*1;
                  4,  final a softmax for binary classification;
                  Total network learning parameters are 8 million.
                  Network architecture is referred at https://github.com/Hui-Xie/OvarianCancer/blob/master/SkyWatcherModel.py

response Loss Function:   focus loss  with weight [3.3, 1.4] for [0,1] class separately, as [0,1] uneven distribution.
segmentation loss function: focus loss  with weight [1.0416883685076772, 39.37007874015748, 68.39945280437757] for label (0, 1, 2)

Data:   training data has 113 patients, and valdiation data has 27 patients with training/test rate 80/20.
        We randomize all data, and then assign same distrubtion of treat reponse 0,1 into to training and test data set.
        

Training strategy:  50% probability of data are mixed up with beta distribution with alpha =0.4, to feed into network for training. 
                    No other data augmentation, and no dropout.  

                    Learning Scheduler:  Reduce learning rate on  plateau, and learning rate patience is 30 epochs.
