Experiment Design:
1  Only choose latent vectors which have a high dice greater than 82%;
2  the 35 latent vector at dir: /home/hxie1/data/OvarianCancerCT/primaryROI1_1_3/training/latent/latent_20191210_024607
   meet high dice standard;

Report:
1  This experiment(ExpHighDiceLatentVector_CV_20191223) uses only 35 high-segmentatation-dice patients' latent vector, which corresponds with high dice against full 3D ground truth
    (minDice = 82%, meanDice=92.88%, maxDice=98.16%).
2  35 patients have mojority response 1s of 57.14%;
3  10-fold cross validation of 35 high dice patients: train 8 folds, validate 1 fold, and test 1 fold;
4  model choosing: in each fold cross validation, save the network model with the  max validation accuracy, and then use this saved model for independent test-fold test;
5  Merge 10 fold test results with 10 models over the all dataset , compute its accuracy and  sensitivity(TPR) and specificity(TNR):
    VoteClassifier: accuracy = 0.6, TPR =0.55, TNR=0.6666666666666666 for total N=35 test files 10 folds

Analysis:
1  Comparing with experiment Latent_CV_20191221, its accuracy improves 1%;
2  But this 33 high-dice patient dataset has majority 1s of 57.14%, which means its accuracy over 10-fold cross validation exceeds majority prediction about 3%;
3  Can we say high dice give a better result? I am not sure as data set is too small.
