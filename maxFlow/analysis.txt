Opencv3 Maxflow/mincut algorithm:
https://github.com/bvirxx/opencv3
maxFlow()                                      48 s           grabcut()                63 s
parallel maxFlow() (64 regions, 8 threads)     18 s           parallel grabcut()       34 s

Cuda version: Graph Cut

OpenCV GraphCut: (Good explanation)
https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d83/tutorial_py_grabcut.html
Source node and Sink node. Every foreground pixel is connected to Source node and every background pixel is connected to Sink node.

openCV maxflow code: it only return flow, instead of mincut.

Professor Xu ask: how to detemine learning rate such that after some edge capacity changes,  predicted mincut is more close to ground truth mincut?
