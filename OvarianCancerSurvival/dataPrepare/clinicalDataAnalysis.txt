TNM system:
T: X, 0, 1,2,3,
N: X, 0, 1,2,3
M: X, 0, 1,

stage:
Stage 0:
	Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue. Also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS. CIS is not cancer, but it may become cancer.
Stage I, Stage II, and Stage III:

optimal result:
A  after surgery, tumor<2cm;
B  survive for 90 days after surgery;
C  chemical therapy reponse good;

Current data:
1  residual tumor size;
2  survive months; (but it is not correspond with days)
3  months_FU: months_FollowUp
