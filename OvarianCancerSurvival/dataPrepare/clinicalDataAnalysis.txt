cell type: 12 types.

low grade serous,
High grade adenocarcinoma,
Adenocarcinoma of mullerian origin,
serous borderline,
borderline serous with micro invasion
papillary serous of the endometrium,
no cancer
granulosa cell tumor
mixed high grade serous and endometrioid

TNM system:
T: X, 0, 1,2,3,
N: X, 0, 1,2,3
M: X, 0, 1,

stage:
Stage 0:
	Abnormal cells are present but have not spread to nearby tissue. Also called carcinoma in situ, or CIS. CIS is not cancer, but it may become cancer.
Stage I, Stage II, and Stage III:
	Cancer is present. The higher the number, the larger the cancer tumor and the more it has spread into nearby tissues.
Stage IV:
	The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body.

0, I, II, III, IV, with A,B,C as substage.

ovarian cancer stage.


optimal result:
A  after surgery, tumor<2cm;
B  survive for 90 days after surgery;
C  chemical therapy reponse good;

Current data:
1  residual tumor size;
2  survive months; (but it is not correspond with days)
3  months_FU: months_FollowUp

Pofessor Wu directed:
1  For each patient, consider its specific cancer range to choose proper slice range;
2  and then downsample and upsampel to get uniform image size;
3  may consider 3D convolution to do this job;
4  when the new server arrive, ralaunch this job;
