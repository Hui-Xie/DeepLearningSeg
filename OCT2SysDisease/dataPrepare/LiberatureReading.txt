Professor Wang,

These 4 paper you recommended are very good reference for our project.
I try to use one sentense to capture their core medical conclusions. Their conclusions have some conflicts.
Macular layer thickness may thin along aging, and macular layer thinning may predict hypertension;
but mucular layer thickness may has no relationship with ischemic stroke which closely related with hypertension;
macular lay thickness can only relate with CKD stage 3 and 4, but not on CKD stage 1 and 2, in the context CKD is a byproduct of hypertension.

These 4 papers are very helpful to design our network architecture. We need this kind of medical knowledge to think our network architecture.
In the fuure, more this kind papers are welcome.  Thank you very much, professor Wang.

Utility of optical coherence tomography angiography in detecting vascular retinal damage caused by arterial hypertension.
European Journal of Ophthalmology, 30(3), 579–585. https://doi.org/10.1177/1120672119831159

This paper used OCTA(Optical Coherence Tomograph Angiograph) to get rich blood vessel information 3D angiogram of retina images,
and concluded that hypertension patients have thinner macular thickness and lower mucular perfusion density(blood vessel network area rate).

Retinal layers and visual conductivity changes in a case series of microangiopathic ischemic stroke patients.
BMC Neurology, 20(1), 1–9. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-020-01894-y

There is no significant retinal thickness change between ischemic stroke patients and control group.

Physiological changes in retinal layers thicknesses measured with swept source optical coherence tomography.
PLoS ONE, 15(10 October), 1–14. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240441

This paper used swept-source OCT, which can get deeper choroid images, to show that all retina layers and choroid layer are progressively thinning along increasing age,
especially after age 50.

Association of reduced inner retinal thicknesses with chronic kidney disease.
BMC Nephrology, 21(1), 1–12. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-019-1679-1

In the chronic kidney disease(CKD) stage 3 and 4, explicit macular thickness decrease. But in CKD stage 1 and 2, no macular thickness changes were detected.
