Thickness and Texture enface map's further improvement:
1  Maybe 3x3 filters to extract feature is not good:
   as slice gap is 240.555 um; while in B scan, the y resolution is 3.87 um and x resolution is 11.29 um (1 um = 0.001 mm);
   Therefore in the enface map, what we saw is 240.555x11.29 um/pixel resolution in Y and X direction, which is 21.3 times difference in Y and X direction.
2  whole enface image physical size: (240.555*31) x (11.29*520) = 7457x 5780 um^2,  image H: W = 1.29:1;

3  Further possible improvement:
   A design 1D filter [1x21]  with step size [1,10] or 2D filter [3x65] with stepsize [1,32] may grasp the physical square area;
   B or [1, 65] and [3, 195] filters to grasp a 1:3 rectangle physical area.
   C or [1x17] or [3, 51] filters to grasp 1.29:1 rectangle physical area;

4 240.55/11.29 = 21.3, how about at X direction, average 21 pixels into 1, so orignal enface image becomes 31x24.38 = 31x25 pixels.
  It guarantees that pixel has same resolution at Z and X direction. 512 = 24x21+1x8
