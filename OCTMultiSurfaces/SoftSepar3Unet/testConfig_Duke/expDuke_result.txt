# on validation set with pixel resolution of 3.24 micrometer, at 11:30pm of Friday.
expDuke_20200902A_SurfaceSubnet: meanMuerror = 2.196 micrometer, epoch=74, learningRate=5e-3,
                                 surfaceMuError: surface0 = 1.017, surface1=2.45, surface2= 3.141
                                 Now valiation loss is increasing.

expDuke_20200902A_RiftSubnet:    meanSepartionerror = 3.881 micrometer, epoch=101, learningRate=1.25e-3,
                                 riftError: rift0 = 3.089, rift1=4.673
                                 Now validation loss is still decreasing.

1 Duke data is training:
  A   data set statistics:
  training set: 266 volumes x 51 slices per volume, where 187 AMD + 79 control = 266 volumes;
  validation set: 59 volumes x 51 slice per volume, where 41 AMD + 18 control  =  59 volumes;
  test set:  59 volumes x 51 slice per volume, where 41 AMD + 18 control  =  59 volumes;
  B   Now SurfaceSubset and SeparationSubset are in training separately, very slow, about 33 min/epoch;
      Duke data is about 12.7 times of Tongren data in the slices number: (266+59)*51/(42*31) = 12.7;
  C   After 32 epochs, surfaceSubset got mean surface error 2.6 micrometer in resolution of 3.24 micrometer per pixel;
      After 28 epochs, separationSubst got mean separation error 4.3 micrometer;
      both networks are still in training;
  D   At the moment, surface 0 get 1.4 micrometer, surface 1 gets 2.8 micrometer, surface 2 gets 3.7 micrometer errors;
      It shows the surface0 is very easy, while surface2 is harder to segment, which is led by the difference of different surface information;

2 Grid search-lambda script is ready, waiting the Duke network finishing pretraining;
  An intuitive analysis from below A and B may predict that our further grid search may still get a very small lambda.
  A  learning lambda also gets very small lambda  of 1e-11 level;
  B  Binary search: when lambda =0.01, muError =13; when lambda=0.0001, muError = 2.07 for Tongren data;
  As search-lambda network needs 3 GPUs in which SurfaceSubset and SeparationSubset run 2 GPUs, current GPU resource is busy on Duke.
  We need to wait for Duke to finish training, and then launch grid search lambda.

Plan:
1 As Duke data training is very slow, I plan to launch ovarian cancer project tomorrow;
2 When Duke data training finish, I will come back to continue Duke data work;
